Let's say you have a lot of files for different episodes of a show in one directory, and you want to 
automatically play the one that's next without remembering which one you played last. This script
is for that. 

Note: files will play in alphabetical order. 

Future features: 
 - REGEX to choose which episode is next
 - Play next episode automatically
 - Remember how far into an episode you are at, then start playing from there.
